- 👋 Hey yo, I’m @fixxOrz.
- 🖧 I’m interested in Buddhism and mastering the linux command line (it's slow going).
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I’m currently studying computing fundamentals (like what a trace is, how many volts different generations of RAM use, etc.) to take the CompTIA A+
Certification exam before November 2022. After that (assuming I pass), I'm going to take the CompTIA Network+ course and Certification exam then the CompTIA
Security+ Certification with the ultimate goal of geting into a security role. It may be a while...
- ✍🏻 I’m looking to collaborate on something at some point, but I don't have the programming skills yet. HOWEVER, I'm a good writer (BA in English and a law
degree), and I find that most of the linux documentation could use {cough} some cleaning up to be more user-friendly. I'd be open to helping a project
clean up documentation they think needs some work.
- 📫 To take me up on the offer, or for any other reason, you can reach me by messaging me here.
